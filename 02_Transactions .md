Chapter 2: Transactions

# About Transactions

Transactions in MMEX refers to the exchange of monetary value from one account (or party) to another. MMEX supports different types of transactions and allows you to set them to certain statuses. You can also choose from an extensive list of categories or customize your own. This section guides you to manage your transactions and payees.

## Transaction types

_MMEX organize transactions by bank accounts, and you can assign a type to each transaction._

A transaction type informs the user whether it is a withdrawal, deposit, or transfer.

- A **withdrawal** transaction refers to the act of converting and removing an amount of funds from a bank account, savings plan, bank account, or pension into cash. In MMEX, any expense and payment to another party is considered a withdrawal.
- A **deposit** transaction refers to the act of placing a sum of money into a bank account. In MMEX, any money you receive from another party is considered a deposit.
- A **transfer** transaction refers to the act of transferring a sum of money from a bank account to another account. In MMEX, any money that is withdrew from one account and deposited to another is considered a transfer. These transactions are not included in the MMEX Income/Expense calculations.

## Transaction Statuses

_MMEX organize transactions by bank accounts, and you can assign a status to each transaction._

A transaction status informs the user where a transaction is in the transaction process. These are the five status options:

- **None** : This is the default status. Choosing this leaves the status information for the transaction as blank.
- **Reconciled** : A transaction can be marked with a &quot;Reconciled&quot; status when the transaction is checked and verified with your card company&#39;s balance information.
- **Void** : A transaction can be marked with a &quot;Void&quot; status if the transaction is invalid or cancelled. Void **transactions** are archived and are not included in the MMEX Income/Expense calculations.
- **Follow**** up**: A transaction can be marked with a &quot;Follow up&quot; status if it needs more actions. It acts as a reminder for you to follow up with your financial institutions or edit the transaction as required.
- **Duplicate** : A transaction is automatically marked with a &quot;Duplicate&quot; status when MMEX recognizes it as one.
