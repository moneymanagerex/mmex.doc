Chapter 4: Assets and Budgeting

# About Assets

An asset is something of value that can be converted into cash. With MMEX, you can track the values of your personal assets and even calculate your financial worth. MMEX estimates your financial worth by subtracting your liabilities (things you owe) from your assets (things you own). To know more about assets, read this article on [what an asset is](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/what-is-an-asset.asp#:~:text=An%20asset%20is%20something%20containing,%2C%20artwork%2C%20or%20home%20goods.).

MMEX supports the creation of seven types of assets. These assets are:

- Property
- Automobile
- Household Object
- Art
- Jewelery
- Cash
- Other

You can track the value of your assets by specifying their current value and make changes to them in the future. There are two kinds of value changes: Appreciates and Depreciates. Appreciates refer to the increase in the value of an asset over time, and depreciates refer to the decrease in the value of an asset over time.
