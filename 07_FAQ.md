### How to record credit card payment

Before you make a credit card or line of credit payment, reconcile the credit card or line of credit account. Then take note of how much of the debt you intend to pay, and follow these steps to make a payment to the bank or card issuer:

1. Open the register of the account from which you intend to make the payment.

You probably want to open your checking account register.

2. Click the Withdrawal tab at the bottom of the register window.

3. Click the Common Withdrawals button, choose Credit Card Payment, and then choose the name of the credit card account where you track the credit card that you want to make a payment on.

The words “Credit Card Payment” and the name of the credit card account appear in the Category box on the transaction form.

4. Enter a check number in the Number text box if the number that appears there isn’t correct.

Remember, you can click the down arrow and choose Next Check Number to enter the next available check number in the box.

5. In the Date text box, enter the date that you wrote or will write on the check.

6. Enter the amount of the check in the Amount text box.

Hopefully you can pay off the entire credit card or line of credit bill, but if you can’t, Money doesn’t care. Money continues to track what you owe from month to month.

7. If you care to, write a few descriptive words in the Memo text box.

8. Click the Enter button or press Enter.

The amount you paid is deducted from the checking account. Meanwhile, the You Owe amount in the credit card or line of credit register decreases or is brought to zero. In effect, you have transferred money from your checking account to the account where you track credit card charges.

### Budgeting
Q: I have been using Money Manager for a few months now and want to start using the budget section but I can't figure out how to edit the categories and sub-categories. Can It be done and if so can someone please offer some guidance?

A: Assuming you've edited, added or changed the budget categories to names you want.

Now go to Budget Setup on the tool menu.

Add Year -> Type 2020 and Based on "None"

Now go to View -> Navigation (unfortunately there's no other way I can find to get to the budget editing screen
Scroll down to Budget Setup and expand the selection, you'll see you 2020 budget.
Now click 2020 and see your budget template page with all the categories

Double click on any budget category/subcategory and you can set the type (expense or income), amout and frequency.. Note: to set it back to none, just type zero in the amount and click OK.

This give you your Annual budget.

Now, if you also want monthly budget, click the access budget setup either from Tools menu or double click Budget Setup.
Select Add Month and create a budget for the month (e.g. Year=2020, Month=9), set Based on to 2020 and it'll take the values from the 2020 budget you have just setup.

Now you can add/edit the monthly items if you have some variance or unexpected expense that month.
