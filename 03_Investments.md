# About stocks and shares

You can easily track your investment in stocks and shares with MMEX. MMEX automatically adds your Stocks to your total financial worth.

The terms &quot;stocks&quot; and &quot;shares&quot; are often used interchangeably, and they generally have the same meaning, but their meaning could also change depending on the context they are used in.

Investment professionals use &quot;stocks&quot; to refer to publicly traded companies. The majority of issued stocks are &quot;Common Stocks&quot;, which is the type of stock that most people invest in and represents shares of ownership in the corporation.

Shares, on the other hand, refers to a single smallest denomination (unit of value) of a corporation&#39;s stock. The two main types of shares are &quot;Common Shares&quot; and &quot;Preferred Shares&quot;, and they carry different rights and privileges. For more information, read this article on the [differences between stocks and shares](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-shares-and-stocks/).

Note: You need a stockbroker to obtain stocks and purchase and sell shares. MMEX is only a tracking tool.
